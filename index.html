		<p>Today, I had the pleasure of interviewing my roommate, Daniela Ortiz. I interviewd her in our room. I've decided to interview Dani because although we spend a lot of time together, I've never actually had a chance to ask her questions. She grew up in Montgomery, New York. She has an older brother who graduated from St. Mark's last year. </p>			
		<h2>What is your favorite food? Why? </h2>
		<p>Her favorite food is mac and cheese because her dad makes really good mac and cheese. She liked mac and cheese ever since she was little. </p>
		<h2>What is your favorite music? Why do you like it?</h2>
		<p>Her favorite artist is Ed Sheeran but she enjoys listening to all kinds of music. She likes Ed Sheeran becuase most of his songs have good meaning and make her feel good. </p>
		<h2>What is your favorite vacation place? Do you have any specific memories that you can share?</h2>
		<p>Her favorite vacation place is Topsail Island in North Carolina and she first went there when she was nine. She stayed there for 2 weeks when her family rented someoneâ€™s house. She collected a lot of seashells with her mom and she still keeps them in her room.<p>
		<h2>What is one thing in the world that you would like to accomplish when you are older? </h2>
		<p>She would like to make a difference whether that is in her career or family later in her life.</p>
		<h2>What is one thing in the world that you would like to change?</h2>
		<p>She wishes that people see everyone as humans and acknowledge that we are more similar than we are different.</p>
		<h2>What is one thing in the world that makes you most happy?</h2>
		<p> Her family makes her most happy. She is very close with her brother and most of the time, they end up laughing when they're together. She enjoys listening to music together. </p>
